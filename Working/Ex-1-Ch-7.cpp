    1. Starting from the file calculator08buggy.cpp, get the calculator to compile.
    2. Go through the entire progaram and add appropriate comments.
    3. As you commented, you found errors (deviously inserted especially for you to find). Fix them; they are not in the text of the book.
    4. Testing: preapare a set of inputs and use them to test the calcultator. Is your list pretty complete? What should you look for? Include negative values, 0 very small, very large, and "silly" inputs.
    5. Do the testing and fix any bugs taht you missed when you commented.
    6. Add a predefinede name k meaning 1000.
    7. Give the usera a square root function sqrt(), for example, sqrt(2+6.7). Naturally, the value of sqrt(x) is the square root of x; for example, sqrt(9) is 3. Use the standard library sqrt() function
       that is available through the header std_lib_facilities.h. Remember to update the comments, including the grammar.
    8. Catch attempts to take the sqare root of a negative number an print an appropriate error mesage.
    9. Allow the user to user pow(x, i) to mean "Multiply x with itself i times"; for example, pow(2.5, 3) is 2.5*2.5*2.5. Require i to be an integer using the technique we used for %.
